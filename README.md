- Each **Property** can receive multiple **Reviews** from different **Users** (one-to-many relationship).
- Each **Payment** is linked to a single **Booking** (one-to-one relationship).

  ## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
The user management feature allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. This functionality is crucial for creating a personalized experience, enabling users to access their bookings, properties, and reviews seamlessly.

### Property Management
This feature enables users to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. By allowing hosts to manage their properties effectively, it ensures that the platform remains dynamic and up-to-date with available listings.

### Booking System
The booking system facilitates the reservation of properties by users. It manages the booking details, including check-in and check-out dates, and ensures that users can easily secure accommodations that meet their needs.

### Payment Processing
The payment processing feature integrates a secure payment system to handle transactions related to bookings. This functionality ensures that payments are processed efficiently and safely, providing users with confidence during their transactions.

### Review System
The review system allows users to leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature contributes to building trust within the community, helping future guests make informed decisions based on past experiences.

### Data Optimization
This feature focuses on optimizing data retrieval and storage to enhance application performance. By implementing strategies such as indexing and caching, the system ensures that users experience quick access to information, improving overall satisfaction.
## API Security

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be. By implementing secure login mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth, we protect user accounts and sensitive information. This measure is crucial for safeguarding personal data and preventing unauthorized access.

#### 2. Authorization
Authorization controls what authenticated users can do within the application. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be utilized to ensure that users can only access features and data relevant to their roles. This is vital for protecting sensitive actions, such as modifying property listings or accessing payment information.

#### 3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make to the API within a specified timeframe. This measure helps prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, ensuring that the application remains responsive and available for legitimate users.

#### 4. Data Encryption
All sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit and at rest. This protects user data from interception and unauthorized access, maintaining confidentiality and trust in the platform.

#### 5. Input Validation
Input validation ensures that all user inputs are checked and sanitized before processing. This measure is critical for preventing injection attacks and ensuring that the application behaves as expected, reducing vulnerabilities.

### Importance of Security
Implementing robust security measures is crucial for protecting user data, securing payment transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the application. By prioritizing security, we build trust with our users, ensuring a safe and reliable experience on the platform.
## CI/CD Pipeline

### What are CI/CD Pipelines?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. CI/CD pipelines are automated processes that allow developers to frequently integrate code changes, automatically run tests, and deploy applications to production environments. This approach ensures that code changes are validated and deployed quickly and reliably, minimizing the risk of errors and downtime.

### Importance for the Project
Implementing CI/CD pipelines is crucial for the Airbnb Clone project as it enhances collaboration among team members, ensures code quality through automated testing, and accelerates the deployment process. By automating these steps, we can focus more on developing features and improving the application rather than managing manual deployment processes.

### Tools for CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: A powerful tool for automating workflows directly from your GitHub repository, allowing for seamless integration and deployment.
- **Docker**: Utilized for creating consistent development and production environments, ensuring that the application runs smoothly regardless of where it is deployed.
- **Travis CI or CircleCI**: Alternative tools that can also be used for continuous integration and deployment processes, providing automated testing and deployment capabilities.

By leveraging these tools within our CI/CD pipeline, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of our development workflow.
